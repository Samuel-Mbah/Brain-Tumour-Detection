# Brain-Tumour-Detection
Will utilise convolutional neural network (CNN) to develop a model to accurately detect brain tumours from MRI images./n
Dataset is classified into 4 tumour groups- glioma_tumor, meningioma_tumor, no_tumor, pituitary_tumor/n
Dataset is divided into 2- training and testing dataset./n
Training folder contains 2870 images/n
